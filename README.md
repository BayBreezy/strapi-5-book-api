# Strapi 5 - Book API

![Scalar Docs](/scalar.jpg)

This API acts a starting point for your next Strapi 5 API ðŸŽ‰
It contains a few key plugins(that I think are needed in all Strapi5 apps)

## ðŸ”Œ Plugins

The following plugins are included in this API:

- Media Prefix
- Gen Types
- Config Sync
- Init Admin User
- Logz

## ðŸ”‘ OpenApi

There is also a ready to use Postman collection in the [open-api](/open-api/) folder.

You can just import it into your Postman and start testing the API.

There is also a script that can be used to convert the Postman collection to an OpenAPI file.

```bash
npm run openapi
```

You can see what the generated thing looks like [here](/open-api/openapi-spec.yml)

Just copy the generated spec and paste it into [Scalar](https://docs.scalar.com/)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with this API, first clone it and then install the dependencies.

Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

Be sure to update the values in the file.
